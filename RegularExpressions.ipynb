Introduction to Regular Expressions (`re`)\n","\n","A **Regular Expression** (or Regex) is a special sequence of characters that uses a search pattern to find a string or set of strings.\n","\n","* **The Module:** Python has a built-in module called `re`.\n","* **The Raw String Rule:** Always use **Raw Strings** (`r\"pattern\"`) for regex patterns. This prevents Python's standard string escaping (like `\\n`) from clashing with Regex escaping (like `\\d`).\n","\n","```python\n","import re\n","\n","text = \"My phone number is 123-456-7890.\"\n","\n","# Simple pattern to find the phone number\n","# \\d means \"digit\", {3} means \"3 times\"\n","pattern = r\"\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\"\n","\n","match = re.search(pattern, text)\n","print(match.group())  # Output: 123-456-7890\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Basic Metacharacters\n","\n","Metacharacters are characters with special meanings. They are the building blocks of regex.\n","\n","| Character | Meaning | Example | Matches |\n","| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n","| `.` | **Wildcard** (Any character except newline) | `h.t` | hat, hot, hit, h@t |\n","| `^` | **Starts With** | `^Hello` | Only if string starts with \"Hello\" |\n","| `$` | **Ends With** | `World$` | Only if string ends with \"World\" |\n","| `\\` | **Escape** | `\\.` | Matches a literal dot `.` |\n","| ` | ` | **OR** | `ai |\n","\n","```python\n","import re\n","\n","s = \"cat mat bat rat\"\n","\n","# Find words starting with 'c' or 'm' followed by 'at'\n","results = re.findall(r\"[cm]at\", s)\n","print(results) # ['cat', 'mat']\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Character Classes (Sets) `[]`\n","\n","Square brackets `[]` allow you to define a **set** of characters to match.\n","\n","* `[abc]`: Match 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n","* `[a-z]`: Match any lowercase letter.\n","* `[A-Z]`: Match any uppercase letter.\n","* `[0-9]`: Match any digit.\n","* `[^abc]`: **Negation**. Match anything EXCEPT 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n","\n","```python\n","text = \"The price is $100\"\n","\n","# Match the '$' followed by digits\n","# We escape \\$ because $ is a metacharacter\n","x = re.findall(r\"\\$\\d+\", text)\n","print(x) # ['$100']\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Quantifiers (How many?)\n","\n","Quantifiers specify how many occurrences of a character are expected.\n","\n","| Symbol | Name | Description |\n","| --- | --- | --- |\n","| `*` | **Star** | 0 or more times (Greedy). |\n","| `+` | **Plus** | 1 or more times. |\n","| `?` | **Question** | 0 or 1 time (Optional). |\n","| `{n}` | **Exact** | Exactly `n` times. |\n","| `{n,m}` | **Range** | Between `n` and `m` times. |\n","\n","```python\n","# 'a' followed by zero or more 'b's\n","print(re.findall(r\"ab*\", \"a ab abb abbb\"))\n","# Output: ['a', 'ab', 'abb', 'abbb']\n","\n","# 'a' followed by ONE or more 'b's\n","print(re.findall(r\"ab+\", \"a ab abb abbb\"))\n","# Output: ['ab', 'abb', 'abbb'] ('a' is ignored)\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Special Sequences (Shortcuts)\n","\n","These are the most used tools in Regex.\n","\n","* `\\d`: Any Digit `[0-9]`.\n","* `\\D`: Any **Non-digit**.\n","* `\\w`: Any Alphanumeric (word) character `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.\n","* `\\W`: Any **Non-word** character (symbols, spaces).\n","* `\\s`: Any Whitespace (space, tab, newline).\n","* `\\S`: Any **Non-whitespace**.\n","* `\\b`: **Word Boundary**. Matches the empty string at the beginning or end of a word.\n","\n","```python\n","text = \"I have 2 cats and 1 dog.\"\n","\n","# Extract all numbers\n","nums = re.findall(r\"\\d+\", text)\n","print(nums)  # ['2', '1']\n","\n","# Extract all words\n","words = re.findall(r\"\\w+\", text)\n","print(words) # ['I', 'have', '2', 'cats', 'and', '1', 'dog']\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. The Big 4 Functions\n","\n","These are the methods you will use 99% of the time.\n","\n","#### A. `re.findall(pattern, string)` - The Data Miner\n","\n","Returns **all** non-overlapping matches as a **list of strings**.\n","\n","* *Use case:* Extracting all emails, hashtags, or phone numbers from a text.\n","\n","#### B. `re.search(pattern, string)` - The Scout\n","\n","Scans the string for the **first** location where the pattern produces a match.\n","\n","* Returns a **Match Object** if found, or `None` if not.\n","* Use `.group()` to get the actual text.\n","\n","#### C. `re.match(pattern, string)` - The Gatekeeper\n","\n","Checks for a match **only at the beginning** of the string.\n","\n","* *Difference:* `search()` scans the whole string; `match()` only checks index 0.\n","\n","#### D. `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)` - The Cleaner\n","\n","Replaces occurrences of the pattern with a new string.\n","\n","```python\n","text = \"Contact: test@email.com or admin@site.org\"\n","\n","# 1. findall\n","emails = re.findall(r\"[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\", text)\n","print(emails)\n","# ['test@email.com', 'admin@site.org']\n","\n","# 2. sub (Redact emails)\n","redacted = re.sub(r\"[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\", \"[REDACTED]\", text)\n","print(redacted)\n","# \"Contact: [REDACTED] or [REDACTED]\"\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 7. Groups `()` and Capturing\n","\n","Parentheses `()` allow you to group parts of a pattern together. This is crucial for extracting specific segments (like the domain of an email).\n","\n","```python\n","text = \"John Doe (Manager)\"\n","\n","# Group 1: Name, Group 2: Role\n","pattern = r\"(\\w+\\s\\w+)\\s\\((.+)\\)\"\n","\n","match = re.search(pattern, text)\n","if match:\n","    print(match.group(0)) # The entire match: \"John Doe (Manager)\"\n","    print(match.group(1)) # Group 1: \"John Doe\"\n","    print(match.group(2)) # Group 2: \"Manager\"\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 8. Compilation for Performance\n","\n","If you are using the same regex pattern inside a loop (e.g., processing 1 million lines), compile it first using `re.compile()`. This saves Python from parsing the pattern every single time.\n","\n","```python\n","# Slow way (inside a loop)\n","# re.search(r\"\\d+\", line)\n","\n","# Fast way\n","pattern = re.compile(r\"\\d+\")\n","\n","lines = [\"Line 1\", \"Line 2\", \"No numbers here\"]\n","for line in lines:\n","    if pattern.search(line):\n","        print(\"Match found\")\n","\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"XS1CssWbXolv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"dk12R04XXpja"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
