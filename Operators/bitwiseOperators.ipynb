The Core Bitwise Operators\n","\n","Think of these as logical gates. For each bit position, the operator compares the bits of two numbers.\n","\n","| Operator | Name | Rule | Example () |\n","| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n","| **`&`** | **AND** | Sets bit to 1 if **both** bits are 1. | `101 & 011 = 001` (1) |\n","| **`|`** | **OR** | Sets bit to 1 if **at least one** bit is 1. | `101 | 011 = 111` (7) |\n","| **`^`** | **XOR** | Sets bit to 1 if **only one** bit is 1. | `101 ^ 011 = 110` (6) |\n","| **`~`** | **NOT** | Inverts all bits (flips 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). | `~101` (yields -6) |\n","| **`<<`** | **Left Shift** | Pushes bits left; fills right with 0s. | `101 << 1 = 1010` (10) |\n","| **`>>`** | **Right Shift** | Pushes bits right; discards far right. | `101 >> 1 = 10` (2) |\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Bitwise Shifting (The \"Math Shortcut\")\n","\n","Shifting is a very fast way to multiply or divide by powers of 2.\n","\n","* **Left Shift (`<<`):**  is equivalent to .\n","* `5 << 2` is .\n","\n","\n","* **Right Shift (`>>`):**  is equivalent to  (floor division).\n","* `20 >> 2` is .\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. The \"NOT\" Operator & Two's Complement\n","\n","In Python, integers are **signed**. This means the `~` (NOT) operator behaves a bit counter-intuitively if you aren't expecting it.\n","\n","The formula for `~x` is:\n","\n","\n","> **Example:** `~5` becomes `-6`. This happens because Python uses **Two's Complement** arithmetic, where the leftmost bit represents the sign.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Practical Use Cases\n","\n","Bitwise operators aren't just for low-level math; they are used in real-world logic:\n","\n","* **Permissions (Flags):** You can store multiple \"on/off\" settings in a single integer.\n","* `READ = 1 (001)`, `WRITE = 2 (010)`, `EXECUTE = 4 (100)`.\n","* Check permission: `if user_perms & READ:`\n","\n","\n","* **Odd/Even Check:** `(x & 1)` is a fast way to check if a number is odd. If the last bit is 1, the number is odd.\n","* **RGB Colors:** Extracting Red, Green, or Blue values from a single hex color code (e.g., `0xFF5733`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Summary Cheat Sheet\n","\n","* `&` is for **masking** (extracting specific bits).\n","* `|` is for **combining** (setting specific bits).\n","* `^` is for **toggling** (flipping bits).\n","* `<<` and `>>` are for **moving** data.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pfbi5bUGxEMh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"-cDciU5nxFRN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
