    "### **Recursive Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions are a special type of function widely used in problem-solving and competitive coding. They offer an alternative approach to standard iteration (loops) by breaking a problem down into smaller, self-similar sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Definition & Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution.\n",
    "* **Key Components:**\n",
    "1. **Recursive Call:** The step where the function calls itself with a modified (usually decreased) parameter.\n",
    "2. **Base Condition:** A crucial condition that stops the recursion. Without this, the function would call itself infinitely (like an infinite loop), eventually causing a crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Basic Example: Countdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple function that prints numbers from `n` down to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fun(n):\n",
    "    if n > 0:           # Condition to proceed\n",
    "        print(n)        # Action\n",
    "        fun(n - 1)      # Recursive Call (n decreases)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tracing the Execution (e.g., `fun(3)`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calling Phase:** The function goes deeper, creating new instances of itself.\n",
    "* `fun(3)`: Prints 3 -> Calls `fun(2)`\n",
    "* `fun(2)`: Prints 2 -> Calls `fun(1)`\n",
    "* `fun(1)`: Prints 1 -> Calls `fun(0)`\n",
    "* `fun(0)`: Condition fails (`0 > 0` is False). Stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Returning Phase:** Once the base condition is met, the control returns back through the chain of function calls to where it started.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recursion has two phases: **Winding** (Calling) and **Unwinding** (Returning).\n",
    "* It functions similarly to a loop (repetition) but uses the call stack instead of a counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Recursion vs. Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relationship:** Any problem solved with recursion can generally be solved with loops (iteration).\n",
    "* **Performance:** Loops are typically faster and consume less memory because recursion adds overhead to the call stack.\n",
    "* **Usage:** Recursion is preferred when the problem definition is naturally recursive (common in mathematics and tree/graph data structures).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Practical Example: Factorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorial of a number is a classic use case for recursion because it is mathematically defined in terms of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* \n",
    "* **Base Case:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fact(n):\n",
    "    # Base Condition: if n is 0, return 1\n",
    "    if n <= 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    # Recursive Step: n * factorial of (n-1)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * fact(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Trace for `fact(5)`:**\n",
    "The function does not calculate the answer immediately. It \"defers\" the calculation until it hits the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Pass (Expansion):**\n",
    "* `5 * fact(4)`\n",
    "* `5 * (4 * fact(3))`\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "* `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * fact(0)`\n",
    "* `fact(0)` returns `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backward Pass (Evaluation):**\n",
    "* Returns `1` -> \n",
    "* Returns `1` -> \n",
    "* Returns `2` -> \n",
    "* Returns `6` -> \n",
    "* Returns `24` -> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** To write a recursive function, think about the problem mathematically: define the **recurrence relation** (how the problem relates to a smaller version of itself) and the **base case** (when it stops)."
