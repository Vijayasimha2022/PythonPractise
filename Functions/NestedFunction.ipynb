    "# Nested Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Nested Function** (or \"Inner Function\") is simply a function defined inside the body of another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python functions are objects that can be passed around, nested functions introduce the concept of **local scope**. They are not visible globally; they exist only within the context of their parent (outer) function. This feature is the foundation for advanced patterns like **Closures** and **Decorators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Syntax and Scope Visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important rule of nested functions is **Encapsulation**. The inner function is hidden from the rest of your program. It can only be called by the outer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    print(\"1. Entering Outer Function\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Defined inside 'outer_function'. \n",
    "    # Not accessible outside.\n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",
    "        print(\"2. Inside Inner Function\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Calling the inner function\n",
    "    inner_function()\n",
    "    print(\"3. Exiting Outer Function\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execution\n",
    "outer_function()\n",
    "\n",
    "# ⚠️ ERROR: Attempting to call inner_function globally\n",
    "# inner_function() \n",
    "# Raises: NameError: name 'inner_function' is not defined\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** If you try to call `inner_function()` from the main scope, Python raises a `NameError`. The inner function acts as a \"private helper\" that only the outer function knows about.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Practical Use Case: Breaking Down Complex Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Why nest functions instead of just writing two separate global functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logical Grouping:** If a helper function is *only* needed by one specific function, nesting it keeps your global namespace clean (`global namespace pollution`).\n",
    "2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** If the outer function performs a repetitive snippet of math multiple times, an inner function prevents code duplication without exposing that logic to the whole world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Example: Quadratic Equation Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the cuboid example, let's look at solving a quadratic equation: . The formula requires calculating the **discriminant** () before determining the roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "def solve_quadratic(a, b, c):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Solves ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\n",
    "    Demonstrates nested functions for formula breakdown.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Inner Function: Encapsulates the discriminant logic\n",
    "    # This logic is specific to this solver and doesn't need to be global.\n",
    "    def get_discriminant(a, b, c):\n",
    "        return (b ** 2) - (4 * a * c)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 1: Calculate discriminant using the inner function\n",
    "    delta = get_discriminant(a, b, c)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Step 2: Calculate roots based on the result\n",
    "    if delta < 0:\n",
    "        return None # No real roots\n",
    "    elif delta == 0:\n",
    "        root = -b / (2 * a)\n",
    "        return (root,)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(delta)) / (2 * a)\n",
    "        root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(delta)) / (2 * a)\n",
    "        return (root1, root2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "roots = solve_quadratic(1, -3, 2)\n",
    "print(f\"Roots: {roots}\") # Output: (2.0, 1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Readability:** The outer function reads like a step-by-step algorithm (`get_discriminant` -> check result -> calculate roots).\n",
    "* **Safety:** No other part of the program can accidentally misuse `get_discriminant` with incorrect parameters, as it is hidden.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. Summary: When to use Nested Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Recommendation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Helper Logic** | Use nested functions when a sub-task is repeated multiple times *inside* the function but has no use outside. |\n",
    "| **Hiding Complexity** | Use them to hide complex implementation details, exposing only a clean result to the user. |\n",
    "| **Closures** | (Advanced) Use them when you need a function to \"remember\" the variables of its parent function even after the parent has finished executing. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Try refactoring a function that calculates the **Euclidean Distance** between two 3D points  and .\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula:** \n",
    "* **Task:** Create an inner function `diff_squared(a, b)` that returns , and call it three times within the outer function."
