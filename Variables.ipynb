    "## Part 1: The Basics of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is a Variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is essentially a **name** that refers to a **value** stored in memory. Unlike statically typed languages (like C++ or Java), you do not need to declare the variable type explicitly. Python infers the type at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `=` operator to assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Integer assignment\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "# String assignment\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean assignment\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Naming Conventions (PEP 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "To write \"Pythonic\" code, follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Snake Case:** Use lowercase words separated by underscores (e.g., `my_variable_name`).\n",
    "* **Case Sensitive:** `Age`, `age`, and `AGE` are three different variables.\n",
    "* **Restricted:** Variable names cannot start with a number and cannot use keywords (like `if`, `for`, `class`).\n",
    "\n"

    "## Part 2: The Memory Model (Crucial Concept)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables are References, Not Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "In many languages, a variable can be thought of as a \"box\" where you store data. In Python, variables are **labels** or **tags** attached to objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Everything is an object:** Numbers, strings, and functions are all objects living in memory.\n",
    "* **The Variable is a Pointer:** When you write `x = 10`, Python creates an integer object `10` in memory, and then creates a name `x` that points to that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reassignment\n",
    "\n",
    "When you reassign a variable, you are simply moving the tag to a new object. The old object is not modified; the variable just points somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10      # x points to integer object 10\n",
    "x = \"Hello\" # x now points to string object \"Hello\"\n",
    "\n",

    "## Part 3: Mutability and Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Identity (`id` and `is`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object in Python has a unique ID (its memory address).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `id(x)`: Returns the memory address of the object `x` refers to.\n",
    "* `is`: Checks if two variables point to the **exact same object**.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Mutable vs. Immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Immutable (Cannot Change):** Integers, Floats, Strings, Tuples.\n",
    "* If you try to change them, Python actually creates a *new* object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mutable (Can Change):** Lists, Dictionaries, Sets.\n",
    "* You can modify the object in-place without creating a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning:** Be careful when assigning one mutable variable to another (`list_a = list_b`). They will point to the same object. Changing one will change the other!\n",

    "Python uses **Reference Counting** for memory management.\n",
