    "## Part 1: OOP Foundations - Classes & Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Paradigm Shift: Why OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "In procedural programming (what we did with functions), logic is often separated from data. As codebases grow, this becomes messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a paradigm that groups **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods) together into a single unit called an **Object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Core Concept: Class vs. Object\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most important distinction to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class (The Blueprint):** A user-defined data type. It defines the structure and rules. It exists in code but doesn't take up memory for data until you use it.\n",
    "* **Object (The House):** An **instance** of the class. It is the actual thing created from the blueprint that sits in memory. You can build thousands of objects from one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The Class (Blueprint)\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    pass  # 'pass' just means do nothing for now\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Objects (Real items)\n",
    "car1 = Car()\n",
    "car2 = Car()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The `__init__` Method (The Constructor)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new object, you usually want to set up some initial data (like giving a car a color). Python uses a special \"magic method\" called `__init__` for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Execution:** It runs **automatically** the moment an object is instantiated.\n",
    "* **Purpose:** To initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, grade):\n",
    "        print(\"A new student is being created!\")\n",
    "        self.name = name   # Attribute 1\n",
    "        self.grade = grade # Attribute 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# __init__ runs automatically here:\n",
    "s1 = Student(\"Alice\", 90) \n",
    "s2 = Student(\"Bob\", 85)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(s1.name) # Output: Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Decoding `self`\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginners often find `self` confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** `self` represents the **current instance** of the class.\n",
    "* **Why we need it:** When you define a class, it's just a template. Python needs a way to distinguish between *Alice's* name and *Bob's* name. `self.name` means \"The name variable that belongs to **this specific object**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** `self` is not a reserved keyword; you *could* call it `this` or `me`, but using `self` is a strict Python convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        # We need 'self' to access attributes inside the class\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "d = Dog()\n",
    "d.name = \"Buddy\" # Manually setting attribute\n",
    "d.bark()         # Python effectively converts this to: Dog.bark(d)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Attributes: Instance vs. Class Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all variables are created equal. Where you define a variable determines its scope and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Instance Variables (Unique)\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined inside `__init__` using `self`. Every object has its **own separate copy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Example:* Every car has a different `color`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Class Variables (Shared)\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined directly inside the class (outside any method). All objects **share the same copy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Example:* All cars have `wheels = 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    # Class Variable (Shared by all employees)\n",
    "    company_name = \"TechCorp\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
    "        # Instance Variables (Unique to each employee)\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.salary = salary\n",
    "\n",
    "emp1 = Employee(\"John\", 5000)\n",
    "emp2 = Employee(\"Sarah\", 6000)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(emp1.company_name) # \"TechCorp\"\n",
    "print(emp2.company_name) # \"TechCorp\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# If we change the Class Variable, it changes for EVERYONE\n",
    "Employee.company_name = \"FutureTech\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(emp1.company_name) # \"FutureTech\" (Updated!)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Adding Behavior (Methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are simply functions defined inside a class. They represent the actions an object can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    pi = 3.14159  # Class Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        # Accessing class variable using ClassName.variable or self.variable\n",
    "        return Circle.pi * (self.radius ** 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def describe(self):\n",
    "        return f\"I am a circle with radius {self.radius}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "c = Circle(5)\n",
    "print(c.describe())        # \"I am a circle with radius 5\"\n",
    "print(c.calculate_area())  # 78.53975\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Part 2: Relationships - Inheritance & Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Inheritance: The \"Is-A\" Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (Child) to acquire the properties and methods of another class (Parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why use it?** Code Reusability (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself). You write the common logic once in the Parent, and all Children get it for free.\n",
    "* **Syntax:** `class ChildClassName(ParentClassName):`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parent Class (The Base)\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        print(\"I am eating food.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child Class (The Derived)\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "d = Dog()\n",
    "d.eat()   # Inherited from Animal\n",
    "d.bark()  # Defined in Dog\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The `super()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a Child class, you often want to run the Parent's `__init__` method to make sure the basic attributes are set up correctly before adding your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `super()` gives you access to the Parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.salary = salary\n",
    "\n",
    "class Manager(Employee):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, salary, department):\n",
    "        # 1. Let the Parent handle the standard initialization\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, salary)\n",
    "        # 2. Then handle the specific logic for Manager\n",
    "        self.department = department\n",
    "\n",
    "m = Manager(\"Alice\", 90000, \"IT\")\n",
    "print(m.name)        # From Parent\n",
    "print(m.department)  # From Child\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Types of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is flexible and supports multiple structures of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single Inheritance:** One Child inherits from one Parent.\n",
    "* **Multiple Inheritance:** One Child inherits from **multiple** Parents (e.g., `class Child(Father, Mother):`).\n",
    "* **Multilevel Inheritance:** A chain relationship (Grandparent -> Parent -> Child).\n",
    "* **Hierarchical Inheritance:** One Parent has multiple distinct Children.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Multiple Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Flyer:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"I can fly!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Swimmer:\n",
    "    def swim(self):\n",
    "        print(\"I can swim!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# This class inherits from BOTH\n",
    "class Duck(Flyer, Swimmer):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "d = Duck()\n",
    "d.fly()\n",
    "d.swim()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Polymorphism: \"Many Forms\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same general class through a common interface. The most common way to achieve this is **Method Overriding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "If a Child class defines a method with the **same name** as one in the Parent class, the Child's method **overrides** (replaces) the Parent's version.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")  # Overrides Animal.speak\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow!\")  # Overrides Animal.speak\n",
    "\n",
    "animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]\n",
    "\n",
    "for a in animals:\n",
    "    a.speak()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Woof!\n",
    "# Meow!\n",
    "# Animal makes a sound\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Duck Typing (The Pythonic Way)\n",
    "\n",
    "In languages like Java, you must explicitly declare interfaces. In Python, we rely on **Duck Typing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't care about the *class* of an object; it only cares if the object has the *method* you are calling.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Part 3: Encapsulation & Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Encapsulation: Protecting the Core\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods together and restricting direct access to some of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many languages (like Java/C++), you have strict keywords like `public`, `private`, and `protected`. Python does **not** have strict access modifiers. Instead, it relies on **naming conventions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Public Members\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax:** `self.variable`\n",
    "* **Access:** Accessible from anywhere (inside and outside the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Protected Members (Convention)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax:** `self._variable` (Single underscore)\n",
    "* **Meaning:** \"Hey, this is for internal use only. Please don't touch it from outside unless you know what you are doing.\"\n",
    "* **Reality:** Python does *not* actually stop you from accessing it. It is a warning sign for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Private Members (The Strongest Lock)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax:** `self.__variable` (Double underscore)\n",
    "* **Meaning:** This variable cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "* **Mechanism:** Python performs **Name Mangling** (changes the name internally) to prevent accidental access.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, balance):\n",
    "        self.name = name       # Public\n",
    "        self._mode = \"Savings\" # Protected (Convention)\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance # Private (Hidden)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        # We can access private members INSIDE the class\n",
    "        self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "a = BankAccount(\"Alice\", 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a.name)        # Works: \"Alice\"\n",
    "print(a._mode)       # Works (but you shouldn't do this)\n",
    "\n",
    "# print(a.__balance) # ERROR! AttributeError: 'BankAccount' object has no attribute '__balance'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Name Mangling (How Private works)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `__variable`, Python secretly renames it to `_ClassName__variable`. You *can* technically access it using this hacked name, but you should never do this in production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing the private variable using the mangled name\n",
    "print(a._BankAccount__balance) # Output: 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Getters and Setters (The Gatekeepers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we shouldn't access private variables directly, how do we read or change them? We use **Getter** and **Setter** methods. This allows us to add **Validation Logic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.__age = age  # Private\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Getter (Get the value)\n",
    "    def get_age(self):\n",
    "        return self.__age\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Setter (Set the value with rules)\n",
    "    def set_age(self, new_age):\n",
    "        if new_age > 0:\n",
    "            self.__age = new_age\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid Age! Age must be positive.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "emp = Employee(\"Bob\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "# emp.set_age(-5)  # Output: Invalid Age!\n",
    "emp.set_age(35)\n",
    "print(emp.get_age()) # 35\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Abstraction: Hiding the Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Analogy:** When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals (Interface). You don't need to know how the fuel injection system works (Implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you want to create a strict \"Blueprint\" that enforces rules on Child classes. For example, \"Every Shape **must** have an `area()` method.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we use the `abc` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstract Class:** A class that cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "* **Abstract Method:** A method that has a declaration but no implementation. Child classes **must** override this method.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Part 2, we learned Inheritance (\"Is-A\" relationship). However, overuse of inheritance can lead to complex, brittle code.\n",
    "**Composition** is often a better alternative. It represents a **\"Has-A\"** relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concept:** Instead of *inheriting* from a class, you create an instance of that class *inside* your new class.\n",

    "### 2. Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use **Multiple Inheritance**, Python needs a strict rule to decide which Parent class to look at first when a method is called. This rule is called the **MRO** (Method Resolution Order).\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3. Memory Optimization with `__slots__`\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, every Python object stores its attributes in a dictionary called `__dict__`. This allows you to add new attributes dynamically at runtime.\n",
    "**The Cost:** Dictionaries consume a significant amount of RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are creating **millions** of small objects (e.g., points in a 3D mesh), you can use `__slots__` to tell Python: *\"I only need these specific attributes. Don't create a dictionary.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Benefit:** Reduces memory usage by 40-50% and slightly speeds up attribute access.\n",
    "* **Drawback:** You cannot add new variables to the object later.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    # Standard Class (Uses __dict__)\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
