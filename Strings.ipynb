Basic Slicing (`[start:stop]`)\n","\n","Slicing allows you to extract a substring from a string. The syntax is `string[start:stop]`.\n","\n","* **Start:** The index where the slice begins (Inclusive).\n","* **Stop:** The index where the slice ends (**Exclusive**). The character at this index is *not* included.\n","\n","**The Golden Rule:** The slice includes indices from `start` up to (but not including) `stop`.\n","\n","```python\n","text = \"Jupyter\"\n","\n","print(text[0:3])  # 'Jup' (indices 0, 1, 2)\n","print(text[2:5])  # 'pyt' (indices 2, 3, 4)\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Defaults (Omitting Indices):**\n","\n","* If `start` is omitted, it defaults to `0` (beginning).\n","* If `stop` is omitted, it defaults to the length of the string (end).\n","\n","```python\n","print(text[:4])   # 'Jupy' (Start to index 3)\n","print(text[4:])   # 'ter'  (Index 4 to End)\n","print(text[:])    # 'Jupyter' (Copy of the whole string)\n","\n","```\n","\n","> **Note:** Unlike indexing, slicing is forgiving. If you specify a range outside the string (e.g., `text[0:100]`), Python won't raise an error; it just stops at the end of the string.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. Advanced Slicing: The Step Argument (`[start:stop:step]`)\n","\n","You can add a third argument to control the \"step\" or increment.\n","Syntax: `string[start:stop:step]`\n","\n","* **Step:** How many characters to jump forward (default is 1).\n","\n","```python\n","digits = \"0123456789\"\n","\n","# Take every 2nd character (Evens)\n","print(digits[::2])  # '02468'\n","\n","# Take every 3rd character\n","print(digits[::3])  # '0369'\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 7. Negative Slicing (Reversing Strings)\n","\n","One of the most powerful features of Python slicing is the **Negative Step**. If the step is negative, Python slices **backwards**.\n","\n","* **Reverse a String:** `[::-1]` is the standard Python idiom for reversing a sequence.\n","\n","```python\n","word = \"Python\"\n","\n","# Reverse the whole string\n","print(word[::-1])    # 'nohtyP'\n","\n","# Reverse a segment (context specific)\n","# Start at index 4 ('o'), stop before index 1 ('y'), step -1\n","print(word[4:1:-1])  # 'oht'\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Understanding the Logic:**\n","When the step is negative:\n","\n","1.

Case Conversion Methods\n","\n","These are used to normalize text (e.g., making user input case-insensitive).\n","\n","| Method | Description | Example |\n","| --- | --- | --- |\n","| `.upper()` | Converts all characters to uppercase. | `\"hi\".upper()` -> `\"HI\"` |\n","| `.lower()` | Converts all characters to lowercase. | `\"Hi\".lower()` -> `\"hi\"` |\n","| `.capitalize()` | Capitalizes the **first character** only. | `\"hello world\".capitalize()` -> `\"Hello world\"` |\n","| `.title()` | Capitalizes the first character of **every word**. | `\"hello world\".title()` -> `\"Hello World\"` |\n","| `.swapcase()` | Inverts case (lower becomes upper, etc.). | `\"Hi\".swapcase()` -> `\"hI\"` |\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 25. Cleaning and Stripping\n","\n","These methods are essential for cleaning \"dirty\" data, such as removing accidental spaces from user input or file lines.\n","\n","* `.strip()`: Removes whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from **both ends**.\n","* `.lstrip()`: Removes whitespace from the **left** (start) only.\n","* `.rstrip()`: Removes whitespace from the **right** (end) only.\n","\n","```python\n","raw_input = \"   password123   \\n\"\n","clean = raw_input.strip()\n","\n","print(f\"'{clean}'\")  # 'password123'\n","\n","```\n","\n","> **Advanced Usage:** You can pass a string of characters to strip specific symbols, not just whitespace.\n","> `www.google.com\".strip(\"w.com\")` -> `\"google\"`\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 26. Searching and Counting\n","\n","These methods help you analyze the content of a string.\n","\n","**A. Find vs. Index (Important Distinction)**\n","\n","* `.find(sub)`: Returns the index of the **first** occurrence. Returns `-1` if not found.\n","* `.index(sub)`: Identical to find, but **raises a ValueError** if not found.\n","\n","```python\n","text = \"banana\"\n","\n","pos = text.find(\"nan\")  # Returns 2\n","check = text.find(\"z\")  # Returns -1 (Safe)\n","# check = text.index(\"z\") # CRASH! ValueError\n","\n","```\n","\n","**B. Counting Occurrences**\n","\n","* `.count(sub)`: Returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring.\n","\n","```python\n","dna = \"ATGCGATCGAT\"\n","print(dna.count(\"A\"))  # 3\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 27. Splitting and Joining (The Data Science Duo)\n","\n","These are arguably the most used methods in data processing. They convert between **Strings** and **Lists**.\n","\n","**A. Splitting (`str` -> `list`)**\n","\n","* `.split(sep)`: Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter (`sep`).\n","* **Default:** If `sep` is not provided, it splits by **any whitespace** and ignores empty strings.\n","\n","```python\n","# CSV Data Parsing\n","data = \"Alice,30,Engineer\"\n","items = data.split(\",\")  \n","# Result: ['Alice', '30', 'Engineer']\n","\n","```\n","\n","**B. Joining (`list` -> `str`)**\n","\n","* `sep.join(iterable)`: Joins a list of strings into one single string, using `sep` as the glue.\n","\n","```python\n","words = [\"Python\", \"is\", \"cool\"]\n","sentence = \" \".join(words)\n","# Result: \"Python is cool\"\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 28. Validation Methods (`is...`)\n","\n","These methods return a Boolean (`True` or `False`) checking the content of the string. Useful for validating user input (e.g., checking if a password contains numbers).\n","\n","| Method | Checks if the string contains... |\n","| --- | --- |\n","| `.isdigit()` | Only digits (0-9). No decimals or negatives. |\n","| `.isalpha()` | Only alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z). |\n","| `.isalnum()` | Alphanumeric (letters OR numbers).

Encoding and Decoding (`str` vs `bytes`)\n","\n","This is arguably the most critical concept for working with **APIs, File I/O, and Network Sockets**.\n","\n","* **Strings (`str`):** Abstract sequences of **Unicode** characters (human-readable text).\n","* **Bytes (`bytes`):** Raw binary data (machine-readable, 0s and 1s).\n","\n","Computers only store bytes. When you save a string to a file or send it over the internet, you must **Encode** it into bytes. When you read it back, you must **Decode** it into a string.\n","\n","**The Methods:**\n","\n","* `.encode(encoding='utf-8')`: Converts `str` -> `bytes`.\n","* `.decode(encoding='utf-8')`: Converts `bytes` -> `str`.\n","\n","```python\n","# 1. The String (Unicode)\n","text = \"Café\"\n","\n","# 2.

This usually means you are trying to decode something that is *already* a string.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 30. `str()` vs `repr()` (The Debugging Secret)\n","\n","Python has two ways to represent an object as a string.\n","\n","1. **`str(obj)`:** Designed to be **readable** for the end-user. (Used by `print()`).\n","2. **`repr(obj)`:** Designed to be **unambiguous** for the developer. It shows exactly what the object is.\n","\n","**The Golden Rule:** `repr()` should (when possible) return a string that is valid Python code to recreate the object.\n","\n","```python\n","import datetime\n","\n","now = datetime.datetime.now()\n","\n","# readable (For users)\n","print(str(now))   # 2023-10-27 10:30:45.123456\n","\n","# unambiguous (For developers - shows type and params)\n","print(repr(now))  # datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 27, 10, 30, 45, 123456)\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Why it matters for Strings:**\n","`repr()` reveals hidden characters like tabs or newlines, which `print()` interprets visually.\n","\n","```python\n","s = \"Hello\\tWorld\"\n","\n","print(s)       # Hello   World\n","print(repr(s)) # 'Hello\\tWorld' (Shows the escape sequence!)\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 31. The `translate()` Method (High Performance)\n","\n","If you need to replace many different characters at once (e.g., removing all punctuation), `.replace()` is slow because you have to chain it (`.replace(\",\",\"\").replace(\"!\",\"\")...`).\n","\n","**`translate()`** does this in a single pass using a translation table mapping.\n","\n","```python\n","# Goal: Remove all vowels\n","text = \"Python is powerful\"\n","\n","# 1. Create a mapping table (a -> None, e -> None, etc.)\n","# The third argument of maketrans lists characters to DELETE.\n","table = str.maketrans(\"\", \"\", \"aeiou\")\n","\n","# 2.

Docstrings (Documentation Strings)\n","\n","Docstrings are not just comments; they are **functional** parts of your code. They are stored in the `__doc__` attribute of a function, class, or module.\n","\n","* **Syntax:** Triple quotes `\"\"\"` as the very first line of a function/class.\n","* **Access:** Via the built-in `help()` function or IDE popups.\n","\n","```python\n","def calculate_area(radius):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Calculates the area of a circle.\n","    \n","    Args:\n","        radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n","    \n","    Returns:\n","        float: The area.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    return 3.14 * radius ** 2\n","\n","# Accessing the docstring programmatically\n","print(calculate_area.__doc__)\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 33. Introduction to Regular Expressions (`re`)\n","\n","Sometimes, string methods like `.find()` or `.split()` are not enough (e.g., \"Find all email addresses in this text\"). For complex patterns, we use **Regex**.\n","\n","* **Module:** `import re`\n","* **Concept:** Uses a special syntax to define a \"search pattern\".\n","\n","```python\n","import re\n","\n","text = \"Contact us at support@example.com or sales@example.org\"\n","\n","# Pattern to find email addresses\n","pattern = r\"[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\"\n","\n","emails = re.findall(pattern, text)\n","print(emails)\n","# Output: ['support@example.com', 'sales@example.org']\n","\n","```\n","\n","> **Note:** Regex is a separate \"language\" within Python.
